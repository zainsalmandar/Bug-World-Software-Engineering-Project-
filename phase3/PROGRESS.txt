Team 6: Milen Vitanov and Steven Abreu
=========================================

What we had on phase_2: 
========================
The previous group had worked on the assembler and simulator. 
- all the classes for the assembler defined and assembler sequence up to export was done.
- the instructions for the assembler could be parsed.
- test cases for all instructions 
- simulator instructions' skeleton


What we improved:
=================

1. made some minor changes to the simulator core classes to make it consistent (execute_cycle() remains to be implemented)

2. divided all the instruction classes in separate header files

3. removing the constructors of the instructions (parse() is setting the properties of the classes)

4. implemented the divided header files for the simulator instructions (all functions)  


Problems carreid on from phase 2:
==================================
- some tests for assembler instructions(testInstructions) and testProgram fail

 
Possible TODOs for next team:
==============================
- See why the tests for instructions and program (assembler) fails and provide fixes
- Implement the read() function in all instructions
- Implement the output() function of Program
- Implement execute_cycle() method of World

Notes:  
=======
-there is a librarys of the asm executable, as for simplifying the testing. Therefore
the library is only a testing component and not to be mistaken with a real library.
-the simulator program and instructions are not complete and will not compile.
